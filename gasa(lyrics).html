Don't Look Back in Anger (Remastered)

<p>
Slip inside the eye of your mind <br>
Don't you know you might find <br>
A better place to play <br>
You said that you'd never been <br>
But all the things that you've seen <br>
Will slowly fade away <br>
</p>


<p>
So I start a revolution from my bed <br>
'Cos you said the brains  <br>
I had went to my head. <br>
Step outside, summertime's in bloom <br> 
Stand up beside the fireplace <br>
Take that look from off your face <br>
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out <br>
</p>


<p>
And so Sally can wait, she knows  <br>
it's too late as we're walking on by <br>
Her soul slides away,  <br>
but don't look back in anger  <br>
I heard you say <br>
</p>


<p>
Take me to the place where you go <br>
Where nobody knows if it's night or day <br>
But please don't put your  <br>
life in the hands <br>
Of a Rock n Roll band  <br>
Who'll throw it all away <br>
</p>


<p>
I'm gonna start a revolution  <br>
from my bed <br>
'Cos you said the brains  <br>
I had went to my head <br>
Step outside 'cos summertime's in bloom <br>
Stand up beside the fireplace <br>
Take that look from off your face <br>
'Cos you ain't ever gonna  <br>
burn my heart out <br>
</p>


<p>
So Sally can wait,  <br>
she knows it's too late as  <br>
she's walking on by <br>
My soul slides away,  <br>
but don't look back in anger <br>
I heard you say <br>
</p>


<p>
So Sally can wait, she knows  <br>
it's too late as we're walking on by <br>
Her soul slides away,  <br>
but don't look back in anger  <br>
I heard you say <br>
</p>


<p>
So Sally can wait <br>
She knows it's too late as  <br>
she's walking on by <br>
My soul slides away <br>
But don't look back in anger <br>
Don't look back in anger <br>
I heard you say <br>
</p>

<p>
At least not today <br>
</p>
